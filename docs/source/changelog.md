# Summary of changes in JupyterHub

See `git log` for a more detailed summary.

## 0.6

### 0.6.1

Bugfixes on 0.6:

- statsd is an optional dependency, only needed if in use
- Notice more quickly when servers have crashed
- Better error pages for proxy errors
- Add Stop All button to admin panel for stopping all servers at once

### 0.6.0

- JupyterHub has moved to a new `jupyterhub` namespace on GitHub and Docker. What was `juptyer/jupyterhub` is now `jupyterhub/jupyterhub`, etc.
- `jupyterhub/jupyterhub` image on DockerHub no longer loads the jupyterhub_config.py in an ONBUILD step. A new `jupyterhub/jupyterhub-onbuild` image does this
- Add statsd support, via `c.JupyterHub.statsd_{host,port,prefix}`
- Update to traitlets 4.1 `@default`, `@observe` APIs for traits
- Allow disabling PAM sessions via `c.PAMAuthenticator.open_sessions = False`. This may be needed on SELinux-enabled systems, where our PAM session logic often does not work properly
- Add `Spawner.environment` configurable, for defining extra environment variables to load for single-user servers
- JupyterHub API tokens can be pregenerated and loaded via `JupyterHub.api_tokens`, a dict of `token: username`.
- JupyterHub API tokens can be requested via the REST API, with a POST request to `/api/authorizations/token`.
  This can only be used if the Authenticator has a username and password.
- Various fixes for user URLs and redirects


## 0.5


- Single-user server must be run with Jupyter Notebook ≥ 4.0
- Require `--no-ssl` confirmation to allow the Hub to be run without SSL (e.g. behind SSL termination in nginx)
- Add lengths to text fields for MySQL support
- Add `Spawner.disable_user_config` for preventing user-owned configuration from modifying single-user servers.
- Fixes for MySQL support.
- Add ability to run each user's server on its own subdomain. Requires wildcard DNS and wildcard SSL to be feasible. Enable subdomains by setting `JupyterHub.subdomain_host = 'https://jupyterhub.domain.tld[:port]'`.
- Use `127.0.0.1` for local communication instead of `localhost`, avoiding issues with DNS on some systems.
- Fix race that could add users to proxy prematurely if spawning is slow.

## 0.4

### 0.4.1

Fix removal of `/login` page in 0.4.0, breaking some OAuth providers.

### 0.4.0

- Add `Spawner.user_options_form` for specifying an HTML form to present to users,
  allowing users to influence the spawning of their own servers.
- Add `Authenticator.pre_spawn_start` and `Authenticator.post_spawn_stop` hooks,
  so that Authenticators can do setup or teardown (e.g. passing credentials to Spawner,
  mounting data sources, etc.).
  These methods are typically used with custom Authenticator+Spawner pairs.
- 0.4 will be the last JupyterHub release where single-user servers running IPython 3 is supported instead of Notebook ≥ 4.0.


## 0.3

- No longer make the user starting the Hub an admin
- start PAM sessions on login
- hooks for Authenticators to fire before spawners start and after they stop,
  allowing deeper interaction between Spawner/Authenticator pairs.
- login redirect fixes

## 0.2

- Based on standalone traitlets instead of IPython.utils.traitlets
- multiple users in admin panel
- Fixes for usernames that require escaping

## 0.1

First preview release
